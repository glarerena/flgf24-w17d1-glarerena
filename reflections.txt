So for this assignment, I was unsure if we were supposed to do a 3 day rolling average with the weatherAPI,
or if we was supposed to use the 6 months of historical data from our city.

Then I seen where you posted it was the users choice Asha, so thank you for that.
I have decided to do a mix of both.

I seen a lot of the fellows struggling just to get an weatherAPI up and running, and pulling data from it.
I did not. I had to use a different email account to be able to get a free trial of the weatherAPI, but that did not take long.
This is the first time I can honestly say, that I used an API, and was not afraid of it at all. I felt confident in my skills, and
thank you JTC for giving me the muscle memory to do this.

The six_months.py file is just what it says. My hometown, Danville, VA. It pull data everyday for the past 6 months.
That is the largest amount of data I have ever pulled from an API so it took a few minutes. Then that got me going down a rabit hole 
about how long the requests can take, computer power, and how you can actually write code to put the requests in blocks, or 
single them out. So each time I work with an API I learn something new. 

The code is written to wait a second between each request, so it does not overload the API.
I saved the data into a CSV file.
Then I got it to print out just some of the basic stats of the data.
I used to be completely nervous to mess with API's, and now I don't feel like a pro or anything,
but I find myself looking at things outside of class that interest me, and I do not shy away from API's.
My father is a daytrader, and he uses the TastyTrade Platform, which has an API, if you have an account that 
you can access. I took my father through the process of getting access to it, and I have written a few basic 
scripts for my father using their API, so he can get personalized trader information sent to his cell phone.

And lastly the other file, learn.py collects data for the last 7 days for my hometown.
Then it takes this history and makes a prediction about what tomorrow's temperature is going to be.
It has 2 parts to the prediction process, where the most recent temperature gets 70 percent of the weight.
Then the other 30 percent of the weight is given to a rolling 3 day average. 


I did use AI for help with both of these code files.
The lectures we received all week long were very informative.
I have done a lot of reading this week.
I have never attempted anything like this before on all of our assignments for this week.
The studying of datasets, and scaling them, and splittling them into smaller sets, and predictions,
this has been very challenging.
